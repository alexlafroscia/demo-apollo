# demo-apollo

> A demo Apollo Server + Ember application

This is a simple GraphQL application that leverages Apollo Server 2.0 and [`ember-apollo-client`][ember-apollo-client]. It is structured in a Yarn Workspace to keep the client and server code together in a single repository.

## Running Locally

1.  Clone the repo
2.  `yarn install`
3.  `yarn start`

Open the application in your browser at `localhost:4200`. The server will be running at `localhost:5000`.

## Tests

You can run `yarn test` in either the project root for either of the package directories to run tests.
